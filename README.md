# orders-poc


My 2 cents:
> - I implemented an API not adhering 100% to REST principles due the fact /orders contains some informations about products. Therotically, it should be a separate endpoint under /orders/{orderId}/products but most of the time clients will need some kind of this api to make BE update order contents atomically.:

Little recap:
- Java 21 + Spring Boot 3 microservice
- PostgreSQL + Flyway for DB migrations
- Very light exception handling
- Custom dockerfile + 2 docker compose (one for prod, one for dev: dev one avoid image rebuilding every time code changes)
- Concurrency demanded to database transactions
- Lombok and Mapstruct to reduce boilerplate code
- Jacoco for code coverage, Spotless for strict code formatting
- Swagger file describing APIs

TODO:
> - Implement some integration tests using some tools, Tavern is an example. Consider also using H2 to make tests indipendent from any external services.
> - Using swagger-codegen, controller and DTOs can be autogenerated and imported.
> - Implement a more detailed error handling mechanism, with a model for errors.
